# Little Taco Shop Project

### Learning HTML
---

I started learning HTML on **October 2, 2024**, and completed this project on **October 7, 2024**. This project, *Little Taco Shop*, is part of my journey to master web development. The aim of this project was to apply core HTML concepts to create the structure of a simple website for a taco shop.

### Challenges Faced
---
- **Confusion with grouping elements**: I struggled with when and how to use `div`, `section`, and other grouping elements.
  - **Solution**: I decided to stick to basic HTML for now and will implement these correctly when I learn CSS, as it will make more sense when styling and layout are involved.

### What I Learned
---
- **Semantic tags**: I understood the importance of using elements like `header`, `footer`, `nav`, and `article` to improve accessibility and structure.
- **Lists**: Both ordered and unordered lists, and their role in creating navigation menus or structured content.
- **Best HTML practices**: I learned about keeping code clean and organized, using meaningful tags, and ensuring accessibility.
- **General HTML tags**: I got familiar with basic tags like `p`, `h1-h6`, `a`, `br`, and `hr`.
- **Tables and structures**: I understood how to build tables and how to structure content within them.
- **Forms**: Learned about various form elements such as `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `button`, and how to embed images and media effectively.
- **Icons and OG Sections**: Learned how to add icons and metadata for better social media representation.
- **And Lot More...**

### Project Overview
---
Here’s an overview of the **Little Taco Shop** website structure:

- **Home page**: Introduction to the taco shop.
